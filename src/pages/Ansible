Ansible is a simple automation tool, can be used by anyone who needs to automate their repeatable process. Unlike chef & puppet it doesnâ€™t use an agent on the remote host. Instead Ansible uses SSH which is assumed to be installed on all the systems you want to manage. The main attractive feature in ansible is it's idempotency, means certain operations that can be executed multiple times without changing the result of the initial application. 

Ansible Terms:
Control Node: The machine where Ansible is installed, responsible for running the provisioning on the servers you are managing.
Managed Node: A host that is configured by the control node.
Inventory: An initialization file that contains information about the servers you are managing.
Playbook: The entry point for Ansible provisioning, where the automation is defined through tasks using YAML format.
Task: A block that defines a single procedure to be executed, e.g. Install a package.
Module: A module typically abstracts a system task, like dealing with packages or creating and changing files. Ansible has a multitude of built-in modules, but you can also create custom ones.
Ad-hoc command: a simple one-off task
Role: A pre-defined way for organizing playbooks and other files in order to facilitate sharing and reusing portions of a provisioning.
Play: A provisioning executed from start to finish is called a play. In simple words, execution of a playbook is called a play.
Facts: Global variables containing information about the system, like network interfaces or operating system.
Handlers: Used to trigger service status changes, like restarting or stopping a service.
